Plan the construction of pieces for free with the Plan Hammer. Anyone can add the required resources to the blueprint and finish the construction.
You still need a hammer and the required crafting station to finish the construction.

Switch between Hammers by pressing **P**.

Planned pieces that are unsupported can not be finished, these pieces are also slightly more transparent so you can see what is and isn't supported.

Includes the **Skuld Crystal**, a wearable item that removes the shader effect from the blueprints, so you can see what the construction will look like when completed.
**Watch your step!** The pieces are still not really there, and will not support you!
Fully compatible with:

- BuildShare﻿﻿: Use the config option (server enforced) to place planned pieces instead
- Build Camera﻿
- Craft from Containers﻿

The hammer's PieceTable is scanned automatically, mods that add Pieces should be compatible. 
If you find a mod that adds pieces to the hammer, but don't show up, try toggling the hammer, it should trigger a scan. 
If it still doesn't work, please post a bug report with a link to the mod.

Most values are configurable:
- Hotkey to switch between Hammer modes (default **P**)
- Show all plans, even for pieces you don't know yet (default **false**)
- Apply plan shader to ghost placement (currently placing piece) (default **false**)
- Color of unsupported plan pieces (default **10% white**)
- Color of supported plan pieces (default **50% white**)
- Additional transparency (default **30%**)
